Abacus will be a cross platform framework of reusable libraries and apis and applications for financial risk and pricing.

Target is to use modern development practices using the best and latest in technology. It's written in C#8 on [dotnetcore](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

It uses ideas and implementations of various existing open source pricing libraries such as [Open Gamma's Strata](https://github.com/OpenGamma/Strata) and [QuantLib.NET](https://github.com/amaggiulli/QLNet).
